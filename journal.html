	CS1 has been a fun class so far, working on things that are completely foreign to me can be intimidating at times but I’ve become a bit more comfortable with the idea of being unsure. I've started on a code sketch that I’m still having trouble with but slowly getting better at googling what I don't understand to figure my own problems out. The weekly labs I do with friends are definitely helpful especially when there's a problem googling won't fix, like the GitHub not working thing. Overall though if I can't figure something out the labs always work and it becomes very clear after it being explained one on one. Honestly, I definitely get confused during classes just because zoning out is way too easy over zoom and if you miss 1 minute the whole thing makes no sense for 5. It just gets kinda annoying to keep trying the same code and when you know you are basically right but there is one little thing wrong that you can't identify just because you aren't fluent in HTML or CSS coding. I’m feeling pretty good overall, not too stressed- contrary to the beginning where I was just very overwhelmed I think I'm calming down about everything in the class. The first code sketch I've worked on is not great, there are still some kinks to work out- hopefully it’ll be done by next week. Javascript is getting clearer every class, definitely would not call myself proficient at writing functions or anything but it’s getting easier. I want to keep working on different code sketch ideas I have just so I have a pretty diverse portfolio for the future, before the big project I do. Overall a pretty good first month in CS1.

	I’m still kind of having trouble with styling my website, making it annoying to organize everything - hopefully it will be done soon. Still having trouble understanding some things, obviously, that’s pretty expected for me but Lab is going to be my best friend through this definitely.

	Skipped 2 of these because I was extremely stressed and kind of froze up-but I'm back down to earth now. Worked on one of my unfinished code sketches, the thanksgiving one in a lab. I had my first case of problem-solving which felt like a fantastic a-ha moment. Still need to update my whole website because it is very unfinished, my journal hasn't been styled yet, but I am working through it slowly but surely
